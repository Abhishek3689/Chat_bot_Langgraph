🚀 Overview

**LANGGRAPH Chatbot is an interactive conversational AI web app built using Streamlit, designed to simulate real-world chat memory.**
- Unlike regular chatbots that forget old messages, this one stores and recalls past conversations — even after you close and reopen the app!**

All chat history is securely stored in a SQLite database, allowing:

🗂️ Multiple independent chat sessions

💾 Persistent memory across sessions and restarts

⚡ Smooth user experience with a Streamlit UI

Whether you return after hours or days, your previous chats remain right where you left them.

### 🧩 Key Features

- ✅ Streamlit-based UI – simple, interactive, and fast
- ✅ Persistent chat memory – powered by SQLite
- ✅ Multiple conversations – continue from any thread
- ✅ Configurable user interface – view and select past chats
- ✅ Extendable backend – can integrate with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
